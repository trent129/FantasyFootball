# FantasyFootball

This is an ETL example of requesting data from the ESPN API Endpoints to create a dashboard that displays different performance and ranking metrics for a fantasy football league. The data being extracted from the API are the scores, names, bid amounts, and transactions for teams on a given week. The data is transformed in the python script to be loaded as a linked excel file to the main dashboard sheet. After transforming, the created excel sheet is loaded into the dashboard sheet via formulas and linked sheets, and subseqeuently creates addtional metrics to rank and track performance over time. This project intially started off as just a manual entry excel sheet, but I have been developing it overtime to create an automated dashboard that adds more context and excitement to the league.  There are more phases to be developed, and it is a passion project I enjoy building up. Any suggestions or comments are welcomed to improve this project!
